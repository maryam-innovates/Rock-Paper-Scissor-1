hii there i am Maryam from pakistan i created this simple rock paper scissors game that you can play with computer easily,you can reset the score if you want.i basically used if-else  conditional statement to check the conditions.and i used math.random for generating a random number then using if-elese again i picked the computer move like if number is bigger than zero and less than 1/3 than pick computer move paper and so on..and using functions i returned the values and i called the functions with inclick with every time passing on the users. kve as if someone had clicked on rock button the i will call my function with onclick while passing on move..thanks for reading
