My Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: A Simple Start
I finally made it! My Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a small yet meaningful milestone in my coding journey.
While itâ€™s super simpleâ€”both in design and functionalityâ€”itâ€™s special because itâ€™s the first project I brought to life entirely on my own.
Although thereâ€™s nothing flashy about it right now, itâ€™s a foundation I can build on, and Iâ€™m already dreaming of upgrades.

The Design: Minimalist and Clean
I went for a straightforward black-and-white theme with a simple layout:

Three buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
The "Rock" button is rectangular, while the other two are circular.
A section to display the resultsâ€”Win, Lose, or Drawâ€”against the computer.
A reset button to restart the game whenever you like.
I kept the design basic to focus more on the functionality and logic. Thereâ€™s no animation or color, but the clean, uncluttered look makes it easy to use.

The Functionality: How It Works
The gameâ€™s core logic is built with JavaScript, and hereâ€™s how everything comes together:

Playerâ€™s Choice:
Each button is connected to an onclick event. When you click one, it captures your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

Computerâ€™s Choice:
The computerâ€™s move is generated randomly using Math.random(). It picks one of the three options stored in an array.

Deciding the Winner:
A function compares the playerâ€™s choice and the computerâ€™s choice, following the classic rules:

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
If both choices are the same, itâ€™s a draw.
Result Display:
Another function updates the result section to show whether the player won, lost, or tied.

Reset Button:
I added a reset button that clears the result display and lets the player start fresh. This functionality keeps the game simple and user-friendly.

What I Learned
While itâ€™s not a flashy project, working on this game helped me understand the importance of small details in coding.
From using arrays and loops to handling event listeners (onclick) and managing the flow of logic with functions, this project pushed me to think like a programmer.

Special Thanks
I owe a huge thanks to David J. Malan and the CS50 course on edX for inspiring me to dive into coding. Every concept
I learned from the course came to life while working on this project, and it feels amazing to see the results of that effort.

Reflection
It might just be a black-and-white game with basic buttons, but to me, itâ€™s proof that Iâ€™m growing and learning. From debugging the reset button to getting the logic to work just right, this project gave me confidence and a sense of accomplishment.


This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m so excited for whatâ€™s nextâ€”bigger projects, more creativity, and maybe a touch of color next time! ðŸ˜Š
